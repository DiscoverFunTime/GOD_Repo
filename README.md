## Specs

#### REQUIREMENTS
* **Database.** Your app needs to have at least 3 resources with appropriate associations and validations.
* **Postgres.** Use Postgres for your database in development and production.
* **Handle invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Do this on both on the client-side with JavaScript/HTML5 and on the back-end.
* **Testing** Your tests should include CRUD specs for your resources. Start by writing tests!
* **User Login.** Make sure you have authentication and authorization set up, using a local strategy. Ensure that your resources are protected and that your authorization is secure!
* **Deployment.** Your app must be deployed to Heroku and ready to present on Friday. 
* **User Experience** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. We suggest you use a front end framework like Bootstrap or Semantic UI.


####Project Plan deliverables:
*You should review the following with the instructional team BEFORE you start to code.*

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Database Schema.** How will you structure the data in your application? Draw out the tables and associations you think you'll need.
* **User Stories/Features.** Write out all scenarios, i.e. As a [user], when I [log in], I want to be able to [add new widgets] to my [dashboard].  Write the corresponding tests for each scenario.
* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.
